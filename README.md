🏥 Vaccination Scheduling System

A simple management system designed to automate the vaccination registration and scheduling process in Egypt. The project reduces manual paperwork and makes it easier for both administrators and users to manage vaccination centers, reservations, and appointments.

📌 Project Overview

Vaccination in Egypt is provided through official Ministry of Health vaccination units. Managing registrations manually is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale.
This project provides a complete digital solution for handling:

User registration & login

Vaccine reservation workflow

Admin approval & appointment scheduling

The system supports two user roles: Admin and User, each with different permissions and features.
